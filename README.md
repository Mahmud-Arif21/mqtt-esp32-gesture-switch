sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
```
   - Then add the following lines, save and exit (`ctrl+x > y > Enter`)
```bash
listener 1883
protocol mqtt

listener 9001
protocol websockets
```
3. Restart the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
```

#### Windows
1. Download the [Mosquitto installer](https://mosquitto.org/download/)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Configure mosquitto.conf
Navigate to `C:\Program Files\mosquitto\mosquitto.conf` and add:
```bash
listener 1883

‚ö†Ô∏è If your <strong>Arduino IDE</strong> is already installed and set up for the <strong>ESP32 board</strong>, you can <u>skip Step 1 and Step 2</u>, and start from <u>Step 3</u>.
</div>
<br>

1. Install **[Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)**
2. Add ESP32 board support in Arduino IDE:
   - Go to `File > Preferences`
   > ![Web Interface](Images/arduino-ide-open-preferences.png)

   - Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json` to Additional Board Manager URLs
   > ![Web Interface](Images/ESP32-URL-Arduino-IDE.png)

   - Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager` and install ESP32
   > ![Web Interface](Images/boardsManager.png)
   > ![Web Interface](Images/installing-esp32.png)

   - Go to `Tools > Board > ESP32 Ardiono` and select **ESP32 Wrover Module** (or your esp32 model)
   > ![Web Interface](Images/esp32-board-select.png)

3. Install required libraries:
   - Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`
   > ![Web Interface](Images/manage-library.png)

   - Install `PubSubClient` and `ESP32Servo`
   > ![Web Interface](Images/pubsubclient.png)
   > ![Web Interface](Images/esp32servo.png)
   
4. Open `/esp32_code/gesture_command_receiver_servo.ino`
5. Update WiFi credentials and MQTT broker address
```cpp
// Wi-Fi Credentials
const char* ssid = "SSID"; // Your Wi-Fi SSID
const char* password = "PASSWORD"; // Your Wi-Fi Password

// MQTT Broker
const char* mqtt_server = "192.168.2.254"; // Your MQTT Broker IP address
// MQTT Topic
const char* topic = "webcam/hand_status";
```
6. Connect ESP32 to your computer and select port from `Tools > Port`
7. Upload sketch to ESP32

## üîå Hardware Connections

### ESP32 to Servo Motor

> ![Connections](Images/esp32-servo-wiring.png)

**Image Source:** [https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-servo-motor-web-server-arduino-ide/](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-servo-motor-web-server-arduino-ide/)

- Servo signal wire ‚Üí ESP32 pin 13
- Servo power (red) ‚Üí 5V or external power supply
- Servo ground (brown/black) ‚Üí GND

### ESP32 LED Indicator

> ![Connections](Images/ESP32-LED.png)

**Image Source:** [https://circuits4you.com/2018/02/02/esp32-led-blink-example/](https://circuits4you.com/2018/02/02/esp32-led-blink-example/)

- Built-in LED on pin 2 is used by default

## üöÄ Usage

1. Start your MQTT broker ([Check Installation & Setup](#üõ†Ô∏è-installation--setup))
2. Power up your ESP32 with the servo connected
3. Launch the **web interface** by opening `/web_interface/index.html` in your browser (this is the main application)
4. Set your credentials and connect
5. Make hand gestures in front of the camera:
   - Open hand ‚Üí Servo rotates to 90 degrees, LED off
   - Closed hand (fist) ‚Üí Servo rotates to 0 degrees, LED on

> ![Web Interface](Images/web-ui-closed.png)

6. This web app also publishes the video stream at the topic `webcam/stream` and the user can turn this on / off, set the frame rate and control how the video stream is sent:
   - **‚úÖ Base64 Enabled:** The video frame (JPEG image) is encoded as a Base64 string, and then sent as text over MQTT
   - **‚¨ú Base64 Disabled:** The video frame is sent as raw binary data (bytes) over MQTT, without encoding

## üìä How It Works

1. **Hand Detection**: MediaPipe tracks hand landmarks in video frames
2. **Gesture Classification**: System determines if hand is open or closed
3. **MQTT Publishing**: Gesture status is published to MQTT topic
4. **IoT Control**: ESP32 subscribes to MQTT topic and controls servos and LEDs

## üîÑ Custom Gestures

The base system detects open and closed hands, but you can extend it with custom gestures:

1. Modify the gesture detection algorithm in `publisher.js` 
2. Update the ESP32 response in `gesture_command_receiver_servo.ino`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure your browser has permission to access the camera
- Try another USB port if using an external webcam
- Check if another application is using the camera

### MQTT Connection Issues
- Verify **broker address** and **port**
   - For the web app, go to `/web_interface/publisher.js` and adjust default IP
   > ![MQTT Broker](Images/broker-ip.png)
   - Using the web app, you can simply add your broker IP in the **web interface**
   
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure firewall allows MQTT traffic

### ESP32 Not Responding
- Check power supply
- Verify **serial output** for connection status
- Confirm **topic names** match between the web interface and ESP32

## üåü Project Ideas

- **Robotic Hand Mirroring**: Create a robotic hand that follows your hand movements
- **Smart Home Control**: Open hand to turn on lights, closed hand to turn them off
- **Drone Navigation**: Control drone direction with hand gestures
- **Media Control**: Change volume, play/pause with simple gestures
- **Security System**: Wave to a camera to unlock a door

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Add more gesture types (pointing, pinch, thumbs up, etc.)
- Implement two-hand detection for more complex controls
- Use the `Gesture Recognizer` task in Mediapipe's `Tasks` API that runs on a pre-trained model bundle and yields high-level gesture categories in real time
- Add machine learning for custom gesture training
- Create mobile app companion
- Add voice command integration
- Integrate with additional hardware for specific applications
- Expand the Python implementation for advanced computer vision capabilities
